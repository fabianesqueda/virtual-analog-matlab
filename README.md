# virtual-analog-matlab

This is a collection of functions and scripts that emulate the behavior of different analog audio circuits. This repository is an attempt to condense the work I've performed at Aalto University on circuit modeling, both as part of my doctoral research and with students. All files come with a brief description of the circuit being modeled and, where available, a link to the relevant literature. This files are provided as a reference only with no guarantee of any kind.
